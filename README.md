This repository contains my hands-on SQL practice focused on writing efficient and interview-oriented queries using practical examples. Instead of using random datasets, I created a Student Table to simulate a real-world academic database scenario.

The student_table includes columns such as:
first_name
last_name
enrollment
major
and other relevant attributes

Using this table, I practice a wide range of SQL concepts including data retrieval, filtering, pattern matching, and logical conditions. Each query is written with clarity and proper comments to explain the approach, making this repository useful for learning, revision, and interview preparation.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my SQL fundamentals through continuous practice, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain a well-structured reference of commonly asked SQL interview questions.

🎯 Key Highlights
Practical SQL examples using a custom Student Table
Beginner-friendly and interview-focused queries
Clean and readable SQL with comments
Organized for easy revision and learning

🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal SQL knowledge base and demonstrates consistent hands-on practice with version control using GitHub.
